#Unity_Explore
A repo recording my learning path in unity.
The exploration is led by scene.

##MeshBasicScene
 - Change the skybox (mat) via ```Window/Rendering/Lighting/Environment```.
 - Create simple 3d mesh via ```+/3D Objects```. 
 - Adjust mesh position, rotation, scale in Inspector View. 
 - Load material via dragging. If the surface type is ```Transparent```, we can set the alpha channel to have transparent effect of mesh.
 - Duplicate the mesh via ```Ctrl + D```.
 - Inspect the mesh in view via ```Shift + F```.
 - Align the mesh via ```Shift + V``` between two features, e.g. corner, of the target meshes.
 - Group mesh together via selecting and ```+/Group Empty Parent```.
